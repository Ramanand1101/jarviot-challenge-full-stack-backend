## Introduction

This backend code provides an Express server that enables interaction with the Google Drive API. It includes features such as authenticating users, fetching user information, reading files from Google Drive, uploading files, and revoking access.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/google-drive-api-backend.git
   cd google-drive-api-backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

Before you begin, make sure to set up the necessary configurations for your project.

1. **Google API Credentials:**
   Create a `credentials.json` file with your Google API credentials. You can obtain these credentials by setting up a project in the Google Developers Console. Make sure to grant the necessary scopes for the Google Drive API.

   Example `credentials.json`:

   ```json
   {
       "web": {
           "client_id": "your-client-id",
           "client_secret": "your-client-secret",
           "redirect_uris": ["your-redirect-uri"]
       }
   }
   ```

2. **MongoDB Connection:**
   Set up your MongoDB connection in the `config/db.js` file. This is where you'll configure the connection details to your MongoDB database. You can use a local or cloud-based MongoDB instance.

   Example `config/db.js`:

   ```javascript
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');
   mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/your-database-name', {
       useNewUrlParser: true,
       useUnifiedTopology: true,
       useFindAndModify: false,
       useCreateIndex: true
   });
   ```

3. **Google OAuth2 Configuration:**
   Configure your Google OAuth2 client ID, client secret, and redirect URIs in the `oAuth2Client` instance. This is crucial for authenticating users and accessing the Google Drive API.

   Example `oAuth2Client` Configuration:

   ```javascript
   const client_id = 'your-client-id';
   const client_secret = 'your-client-secret';
   const redirect_uris = ['your-redirect-uri'];
   const oAuth2Client = new google.auth.OAuth2(client_id, client_secret, redirect_uris[0]);
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Access the server's endpoints to interact with the Google Drive API.

## Endpoints

- **GET /getAuthURL:** Generate and return the authorization URL for initiating OAuth2 authentication.
- **POST /getToken:** Exchange an authorization code for access tokens and save them to the database.
- **POST /getUserInfo:** Fetch user information from the Google API.
- **POST /readDrive:** Retrieve a list of files from the user's Google Drive.
- **POST /fileUpload:** Upload a file to the user's Google Drive.
- **POST /revokeAccess:** Revoke access and delete tokens from the database.
- **GET /auth/callback:** Analysing the risk of Google Drive .
